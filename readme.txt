= History =
Blocking spammers via htaccess or other server settings would do the job, but that would require
to keep all the files in sync. So I decided to write a centralized solution that enables
innocent users to remove their IP from the blacklist via removal request. As a blacklist gets queried
way too often, I added some local detection of spammers to reduce load at my side.
By now many additional features have been added, making this plugin a full grown anti-spam solution.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the contents of the wp-blackcheck directory into your Wordpress plugin directory or use the plugin installer.
2. Activate the Plugin
3. Configure the plugin to your needs
4. Optionally report Spam

== Screenshots ==

1. The Admin-Page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What happens if a blocked IP hits my site? =
The Plugin does not prevent reading of your blog. But if a blocked IP tries to post a comment
WP-BlackCheck will block it, displaying a link to the removal request form.

= What happens if I am blacklisted? =
I'd assume that spammers do not authenticate against your blog. The plugin will block your comments if you are not logged in.

= I am blacklisted! What now? =
Just follow the link to http://www.stargazer.at/blacklist/ and follow the instructions on the page.

= Why should I report Spam? =
Spammers usually hit quite a few servers with their IPs. It's pretty uncommon that you are the only one who has been hit from that IP. Sharing that info prevents Spam on other blogs.

= WP-BlackCheck is not available in (insert language here) =
The plugin comes with a file named wp-blackcheck.pot which contains the messages printed. Feel free to translate it into your language and send the .mo and .po file back to me, so I can include it into the next release.
